I am an experienced software developer and designer dedicated to creating engaging and user-friendly software. With a strong foundation in front-end, full-stack and mobile development, I bring a comprehensive approach to every project I work on. 

I am originally from San Jose, Costa Rica and have lived in Colorado since 2010. I have a B.S. in Computer Science from the [University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.cu.edu/). During my time there, I minored in [Creative Technology and Design](https://www.colorado.edu/engineering/academics/degree-programs/creative-technology-design) and worked for the registrar office as a software developer.  My interests include game development, cooking, skiing, backpacking, and photography.  

I am currently a front-end developer at [Charter Communications](https://corporate.charter.com/) in Denver, CO.
