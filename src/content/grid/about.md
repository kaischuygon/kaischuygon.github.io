I am a passionate and experienced developer and designer dedicated to creating engaging and user-friendly software. With a strong foundation in full-stack and mobile development, I bring a comprehensive approach to every project I work on. My goal is to deliver high-quality, pixel perfect software that not only meet objectives but also provide an exceptional user experience.

I am originally from San Jose, Costa Rica and have lived in the Boulder, CO area since 2010. I have a B.S. in Computer Science from the [University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.cu.edu/). During my time there, I minored in [Creative Technology and Design](https://www.colorado.edu/engineering/academics/degree-programs/creative-technology-design) and worked for the registrar office as a software developer.

My interests include cooking, game development, skiing, backpacking, and photography. I am currently a software developer and data engineer at [Oori](https://oori.dev), an AI startup working primarily with LLMs. On my free time, I work on personal projects including my design portfolio.
