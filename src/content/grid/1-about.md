I am a passionate and experienced developer and designer dedicated to creating engaging and user-friendly applications. With a strong foundation in front-end and back-end development, I bring a comprehensive approach to every project I work on. My goal is to deliver high-quality, pixel perfect websites that not only meet objectives but also provide an exceptional user experience.

I am originally from San Jose, Costa Rica and have lived in the Boulder, CO area since 2010. I have a B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Colorado Boulder. During my time there, I minored in Creative Technology and Design and worked for the registrar office as a software developer.

My interests include cooking, game development, skiing, backpacking, and photography. I am currently a software developer and data engineer at [Oori](https://oori.dev), an AI startup working primarily with LLMs. On my free time, I am working on personal projects including my design portfolio and a wordle-like web game.
