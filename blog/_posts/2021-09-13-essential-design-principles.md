The Principles:
1. Wayfinding
    - Help people to orient themselves
1. Feedback
    - Answer people’s unasked questions
1. Visibility
    - The usability is greatly improved when feedback and controls are clearly visible
- Has to be weighed against other considerations, such as clutter
1. Consistency
    - Representing similar design features in similar ways
    - Inconsistency undermines usability
1. Mental model
    - Oversimplificans of how systems should work, developed from personal experience so everyone’s is unique.
    - How things work and how things should react to interactions
    - When a system matches out mental model, we subconsciously percieve it as inuitive
    - When a system does not match our mental model, we notice it is unintuitive
1. Proximity
    - Distance between control and objects it affects.
1. Grouping
    - Similar controls are close togeather
1. Mapping
    - How controls are arranged relative to each other.
    - Controls resemble what they affect.
1. Affordance
    - Visual and tactile cues a control affords to us.
    - Progressive disclosure
        - Technique for managing complexity.
        - Gradually eases from simple to more complex
    - Hiding away complexity so people can make quick actions with no distractions.
1. 80/20 Rule
    - 80% of systems effects come from 20% of it’s pauses
    - Not all functionality is used. The least used functionality should be hidden to allow more space for the most used features.
    - It reduces clutter and simplifies decision making
1. Symmetry
    - Reflectional, transational and rotational symmetry.
    - Gives sense of order and balance

Good examples of Essential Design Principles
- Apollo for Reddit
    - I’ve used Apollo for a while even though there are plenty of other Reddit clients for iPhone. I keep coming back to Apollo because of how consistent it is with Apple’s design guidelines.
