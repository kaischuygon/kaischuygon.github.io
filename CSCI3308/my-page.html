  <h1>Schuyler Gonzalez, Kai</h1>
  <p>
    I was born in Costa Rica and moved to the U.S. when I was 10. I have lived in Colorado for 10 years but I didn't
    start skiing until last year. I currently work at the Environmental Center at CU. I am studying computer science
    because I want to work in computer graphics, either in the video game or film industries.
