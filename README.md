# kschuygon.github.io

My personal site and portfolio. Built using Astro, TypeScript. Started with Astro's [portfolio template](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/latest/examples/portfolio?on=github). Icons adapted from [Phosporicons](https://phosphoricons.com/).

## Theming
The styles for this site are a combination of [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and vanilla css.
